## 0.4 Using Symbols

1. **Never start a sentence with a symbol.**  
   - Begin sentences with words, not symbols (e.g., "The equation x² − 6x + 8 = 0 has two distinct roots").
2. **Separate symbols with words if possible.**  
   - Add words between symbols to improve clarity (e.g., “the number b”).
3. **Avoid using logic symbols in formal writing.**  
   - Refrain from symbols like ⇒, ∀, ∃, except when discussing logic.
4. **Be cautious with i.e. and e.g.**  
   - Prefer writing out “that is” or “for example” to avoid confusion.
5. **Write small integers as words.**  
   - Use words for small numbers or when describing (e.g., “two groups of order 4”).
6. **Don’t mix words and symbols improperly.**  
   - Avoid combining words and symbols (e.g., write “Every integer exceeding 1”).
7. **Avoid unnecessary symbols in theorem statements.**  
   - Only introduce symbols when essential in proofs.
8. **Define all symbols.**  
   - Explain any introduced symbols (e.g., specify k is an integer in n = 2k + 1).
9. **Use “frozen symbols” correctly.**  
   - Maintain standard uses (e.g., m and n for integers, A and B for sets).
10. **Use consistent symbols.**  
   - Choose symbols that fit together logically (e.g., avoid switching between a, r, and b unnecessarily).
